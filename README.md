# SQLite Heroes of the Storm Data

For my [Flutter Heroes of the Storm App](https://github.com/arranf/Heroes-Companion) I needed the information about Heroes to be stored in a SQLite datbase rather than the JSON form I kept finding so I built a quick Python script to build the database from the [heroes-talents](https://github.com/heroespatchnotes/heroes-talents) repository.
